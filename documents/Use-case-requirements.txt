 Problem Domain: Payments Solution
Let’s assume this is a smart payment management system for users and support agents — where AI helps in transaction classification, risk/fraud detection, user assistance, and smart recommendations.

✅ Step 1: High-Level User Personas
Persona	Description
🧍‍♂️ End User (Customer)	Sends/receives payments, queries transactions
🧑‍💻 Support Agent	Assists with disputes, delays, payment failures
🧠 AI Assistant	AI backend that understands and responds contextually
📈 Risk Analyst	Uses dashboards and insights for fraud/risk

🧾 Step 2: Core User Stories
🧍‍♂️ USER: “As a customer...”
...I want to view all my recent transactions
→ So that I can check if any unexpected payment was made.

...I want to ask questions like “Why was ₹500 deducted?”
→ So that I understand the reason behind each transaction (GPT + vector match).

...I want to categorize transactions as personal, work, utility, etc.
→ So that I can track my expenses better (ML classifier + SQLite).

...I want to receive alerts if a transaction looks suspicious
→ So that I can report or stop fraud (ML + business rules + LangGraph).

🧑‍💻 SUPPORT AGENT: “As a support agent...”
...I want to retrieve a user's payment history quickly
→ So that I can assist them efficiently (FastAPI + SQLite).

...I want to type freeform issues like “card not working” and get GPT responses with possible solutions
→ So that I don’t manually search a knowledge base (LLM + prompt match via Chroma).

🧠 AI SYSTEM: “As an AI assistant...”
...I want to retrieve similar past issues or transactions
→ So that my response is contextually relevant (Chroma + vector embedding).

...I want to decide whether to escalate to human or resolve autonomously
→ Based on risk, sentiment, and history (LangGraph + ML logic).

📊 ANALYST: “As a fraud/risk analyst...”
...I want to see which users have high-risk patterns
→ So that I can flag them for investigation (ML prediction + Streamlit dashboard).

...I want the system to auto-flag transactions over threshold and ask GPT to explain
→ So that I get reasons like “Amount deviation from normal by 250%” (LLM reasoning + rule-based trigger).

🎯 Summary of Capabilities Mapped to Stack
Feature	Stack Component(s) Used
Semantic query over payments	GPT + ChromaDB + Streamlit
Transaction classification	ML (e.g., Logistic Regression or RandomForest) + SQLite
Prompt guidance / completion tuning	Hugging Face datasets + prompt refinement on UI
Smart workflows (auto/escalate)	LangGraph for decision logic
Local/offline inference (optional)	Hugging Face models as GPT fallback
Real-time UI	Streamlit frontend
Backend APIs	FastAPI for interaction and data flow

Would you like to proceed with:

Breaking these into epics/tasks?

Designing a simple MVP feature flow?

Or starting the FastAPI backend + SQLite schema?

You choose the next step.



✅ You might still host synthetic training data there if needed

✅ You might borrow inspiration from datasets like Banking77 for better intent design

 Analogy
Think of this like:

main.py: provides data services

run_agent.py: is an LLM agent that consumes those services

They should remain separate unless you want to expose the agent via API or UI — which we can do later.

If your goal is:

“Expose the GPT agent via a /chat API in FastAPI”

Then yes — you’d import the logic from run_agent.py into main.py, like:
