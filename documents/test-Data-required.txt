1. 🧍‍♂️ End User Data (for transaction history, classification, and queries)
🔹 Required Test Data Schema (Transactions)
Field Name	Type	Example Value	Purpose
txn_id	string	TXN98212	Unique ID for each transaction
user_id	string	USER123	To relate transactions to user
timestamp	datetime	2024-12-21 10:15:00	Time of transaction
amount	float	499.99	Amount paid
merchant_name	string	Netflix, Grab, Shopee	For merchant-based classification
category	string	Travel, Utility, Subscription	ML label or classification target
payment_method	string	UPI, CreditCard, Wallet	To simulate varied flows
status	string	success, failed, refunded	For dispute/failure handling
geo_location	string	Singapore, India	Can aid risk scoring
currency	string	SGD, INR	Multi-currency support
flagged_as_fraud	bool	True / False	For ML training/testing fraud detection

✅ 2. 🧠 AI Assistant / GPT Interaction
🔹 Test Data for Prompt Matching (RAG)
Use FAQ-like QA pairs or user utterances for ChromaDB.

Field Name	Type	Example
query_text	string	“Why was I charged twice for Grab?”
response	string	“You may have placed two orders...”
intent	string	dispute_issue, card_not_working
embedding	vector	(auto-computed for Chroma)

📌 Use this to:

Populate Chroma vector store

Enhance prompt grounding for GPT

Train basic intent classifiers if needed

✅ 3. 🧑‍💻 Agent Support Workflows
🔹 Simulated Support Tickets
Field Name	Type	Example Value	Purpose
ticket_id	string	TKT543	Trace support session
user_id	string	USER123	Link to transaction
issue_summary	string	“Failed card swipe at petrol station”	Prompt input for GPT
status	string	open / resolved / escalated	LangGraph step transition
agent_response	string	GPT-generated or agent-entered text	Quality assessment

✅ 4. 📊 Fraud & Risk Analyst Data
🔹 ML Training/Test Dataset for Risk Scoring
Feature	Type	Notes
user_id	string	Links to user
txn_frequency	int	No. of transactions in last week
avg_txn_amount	float	Average amount
num_countries_used	int	Location spread
num_chargebacks	int	Historical disputes
is_high_risk	bool	Ground truth for classification

🎯 This can feed into your RandomForestClassifier or any risk model.
