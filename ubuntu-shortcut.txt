By default, **Alt+Tab** switches **only within the VirtualBox VM window**, not between your Ubuntu VM and Windows host. But you can absolutely enable smooth switching ‚Äî here's how:

---

### ‚úÖ Options to Switch Between Ubuntu VM and Windows (Host)

#### 1. **Use Host Key to Release Focus**

* **Default Host Key** = **Right Ctrl** (check bottom right of VM window)
* Press **Right Ctrl** once ‚Üí this "releases" the keyboard/mouse from the VM
* Then you can use **Alt+Tab** on your host (Windows)

> üîÅ To go back into the VM: Just click inside the Ubuntu window again.

---

#### 2. **Enable Seamless Mode (Optional UI Integration)**

If you want your Ubuntu windows to float on your Windows desktop:

1. Press **Right Ctrl + L**
2. This activates **Seamless Mode** (after Guest Additions are installed)
3. Ubuntu windows will appear integrated with your Windows desktop

To exit: Press **Right Ctrl + L** again.

#### 3. **Dual Monitor or Fullscreen Shortcut**

* **Fullscreen toggle**: `Right Ctrl + F`
* Switch between apps using **Windows+Tab** or **Alt+Tab** if you release input with `Right Ctrl`.

---

### üîÅ TL;DR:

* Use **Right Ctrl** to toggle control between VM and host
* Then **Alt+Tab** will work across both systems
